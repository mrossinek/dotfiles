# dotfiles

I am running Arch Linux with XMonad as my WM. For my status bar I run two
instances of dzen2: the first one is fed by XMonad with workspace and window
information; the second one is fed by conky with system information (including
interactive buttons!).

Besides the configurations for the above setup, this repo also holds my neovim
and zsh configs. Other tools that I use include neomutt, taskwarrior, khal,
khard and beets.
